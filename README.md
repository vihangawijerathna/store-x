# Store-X

A modern e-commerce product showcase built with vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, demonstrating API integration skills.

## Overview

Store-X is a front-end web application that connects to the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to display product data. This project demonstrates my ability to work with external APIs, create responsive layouts, and implement modern web design.

## Features

- Fetch and display products from the Fake Store API
- Responsive grid layout for product cards
- Clean and modern dark-themed UI
- Hover effects for enhanced user experience
- Product cards with images, titles, prices, and action buttons

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for structure
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with Grid layout and Flexbox
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Async/await for API requests, DOM manipulation
- **Fetch API**: For making HTTP requests to the external API

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/store-x.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd store-x
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser, or use a local server:

   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000

   # Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
   npx http-server

   # Using Live Server extension in VS Code
   # Right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server"
   ```

4. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

## API Integration

This project uses the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) which provides:

- Product listings with images, titles, prices, and descriptions
- No authentication required
- RESTful endpoints for easy integration

## Future Enhancements

- Implement cart functionality (structure already prepared in CSS)
- Add product filtering and search capabilities
- Create product detail pages
- Add user authentication
- Implement checkout process
- Add loading states and error handling
- Implement product categories

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I've demonstrated:

- Working with asynchronous JavaScript (async/await)
- Handling API responses and error states
- Creating responsive layouts with CSS Grid
- Building dynamic content with JavaScript DOM manipulation
- Implementing a cohesive design system
- Understanding of RESTful API consumption
